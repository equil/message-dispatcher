# message-dispatcher

## Info
This is a simple test task about Swift type system to score knowledge and understanding. Task includes small non-completed framework described in [readme of framework](Messaging/README.md) with unit tests and part of sources. In this exercise we intend to discuss the solution and see how applicants are able to solve problems and the way of their thinking. It is up to applicants to perform the task before interview or on the interview: both ways are appreciated.

## Task and expectations
In [MessagingTests.swift](Messaging/Tests/MessagingTests/MessagingTests.swift) you will find a single failing unit test that you need to make green. It doesn't cover all functionality tho; feel free to add more if you feel up to it, but this is not necessary. Your task is to implement methods in **JSONDecodableDispatcher** by replacing `TODO` comments with functionality that fit in documentation.

## Notes

- More details and descriptions you will find in [readme of framework](Messaging/README.md)
- In [tests](Messaging/Tests/MessagingTests) you can find implementations for **Handler** and **Message** implementations if you need more context
- Feel free to use any source of information you want, this will be allowed on interview as well if you will decide to do implementation on interview
- Enjoy, take your time and good luck! :)
